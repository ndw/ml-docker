# ml-docker

This repo contains a set of Docker containers for building and running
MarkLogic server.

## Images

There are three images

* `coreos` is the Fedora 23 base system
* `runner` is a minimal container for running MarkLogic Server
* `builder` is configured to allow you to build the server

### coreos

The `coreos` container installs Fedora 23 and sets up Java. It creates
one non-root user that you can use when `docker exec`ing into the
container.

There are three build arguments:

* `java` a path to a Java RPM to install, you must supply this
* `user` the name of the non-root user, defaults to `devuser`
* `uid` the UID of the non-root user, defaults to `1000`

By setting the `user` and `uid` arguments appropriately, you can allow
the user logged into the container to update volumes mounted on it.

### runner

The `runner` container installs and runs MarkLogic server. You must
supply a MarkLogic RPM to the `marklogic` build argument. You can
download them from http://developer.marklogic.com/

This container also installs the MarkLogic Python API.

There are two build arguments:

* `marklogic` a path to a MarkLogic RPM to install, you must supply this
* `user` the name of the non-root user, defaults to `devuser`
   and must be the same as the `user` passed to the `coreos` image

### builder

The `builder` container extends the `coreos` container with build
tools sufficient to compilee MarkLogic Server. (Assuming, of course,
that you have access to the sources.)

There’s a single build argument:

* `user` the name of the non-root user, defaults to `devuser`
   and must be the same as the `user` passed to the `coreos` image

## Ancillary scripts

Optional: two scripts exists to 'pull' these files during the build.
They are meant to be augmented and are only called if apprprate rpms
are not found. The `getjava.sh` script will pull a java 1.8_60 JDK from
oracle. The `getml.sh` script will simply remind you to obtain a
MarkLogic rpm

## Building the images

A build script is provided in `bin`.

Usage:

    ./build.sh [coreos|runner|builder] {--tag tag} {--user devuser} {--uid 1000}

This builds one of 3 variants. You must build `coreos` first. If you specify
a tag for the `coreos` image, then you’ll have to modify the `Dockerfiles` for
the other images.

Free as in 'Just Free, take it or leave it'.
Maybe 'Free as in Beer' (tm)(c)(R)(wtf) -- but I couldnt ever figure out those fancypants lawyer terms, they seem to mean the opposite of what they seem to mean the opposite of what they seem to mean, or the other way around.
